# Apple Supply Chain Command Generation Ontology
# Ultra-sophisticated BDD scenarios for global supply chain orchestration and sustainability

Feature: Apple Supply Chain Command Generation from Sustainability Ontology
  As an Apple Supply Chain Operations Director
  I want to generate supply chain commands from sustainability ontology
  So that I can achieve carbon neutral manufacturing by 2030 with ethical sourcing and circular economy principles

  Background:
    Given the Untology system is initialized with Apple-scale global supply chain architecture
    And I have Apple sustainability ontology loaded from "ontologies/apple/carbon-neutral-supply-chain.ttl"
    And the ontology contains supplier assessment, material sourcing, and lifecycle entities
    And multi-dimensional schema alignment coordinates 200+ suppliers across 40+ countries
