# Performance Benchmarks and Security Validation for Untology

Feature: Performance Benchmarks and Security Validation for Production Ontology Systems
  As a Performance Engineering Team Lead
  I want to validate ontology processing performance and security
  So that I can ensure production-ready systems meet SLA requirements and security standards

  Background:
    Given the Untology system is initialized with performance monitoring and security validation
    And I have performance benchmark ontology loaded from "ontologies/benchmarks/performance-security.ttl"
    And the ontology contains performance metrics, security controls, and validation patterns
    And continuous monitoring ensures real-time performance and security compliance

  Scenario: Horizontal Scaling Performance for Massive Ontology Processing
    Given I have distributed ontology processing cluster spanning multiple data centers
    And horizontal scaling must maintain performance linearity with node additions
    And global load balancing optimizes cross-datacenter ontology operations
