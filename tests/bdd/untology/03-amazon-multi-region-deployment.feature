# Amazon Multi-Region Deployment Orchestration Ontology
# Ultra-sophisticated BDD scenarios for global-scale infrastructure deployment

Feature: Amazon Multi-Region Deployment Orchestration from Infrastructure Ontology
  As an Amazon Principal Solution Architect
  I want to orchestrate multi-region deployments from infrastructure ontology
  So that I can achieve global scale with 99.999% availability and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions

  Background:
    Given the Untology system is initialized with AWS-scale distributed architecture
    And I have Amazon infrastructure ontology loaded from "ontologies/aws/global-deployment.ttl"
    And the ontology contains EC2, EKS, RDS, and Lambda entities across 25+ regions
    And temporal workflow evolution is enabled for dynamic regional failover
