# JPMorgan Chase Trading Workflow Ontology
# Ultra-sophisticated BDD scenarios for trading compliance and risk management

Feature: JPMorgan Trading Workflow Generation from Compliance Ontology
  As a JPMorgan Chase quantitative analyst
  I want to generate trading workflows from regulatory compliance ontology
  So that I can ensure algorithmic trading adheres to Volcker Rule and Basel III requirements

  Background:
    Given the Untology system is initialized with FAANG-level architecture
    And I have a JPMorgan compliance ontology loaded from "ontologies/jpmorgan/volcker-compliance.ttl"
    And the ontology contains trading entities with regulatory constraints
    And quantum superposition states are enabled for multi-jurisdictional compliance

  @enterprise @jpmorgan @performance @security
  Scenario: High-Frequency Trading Algorithm Validation Under Volcker Rule
    Given I have a trading ontology with the following structure:
      """
      @prefix jp: <https://jpmorgan.com/ontology/trading#> .
      @prefix reg: <https://regulations.gov/banking/volcker#> .
      
      jp:HFTAlgorithm a jp:TradingStrategy ;
          reg:mustComplyWith reg:VolckerRule ;
          jp:hasRiskLimit "100000000"^^xsd:decimal ;
          jp:hasLatencyRequirement "50"^^xsd:int ;
          jp:operatesInMarkets jp:Equities, jp:Derivatives ;
          jp:requiresApproval jp:ComplianceTeam .
      
      jp:ComplianceWorkflow a jp:Workflow ;
          jp:hasSteps (
              jp:PreTradeRiskCheck
              jp:VolckerRuleValidation
              jp:BaselIIICapitalCheck
              jp:MarketRiskAssessment
              jp:ExecutionAuthorization
          ) ;
          jp:hasTimeConstraint "5"^^xsd:int ;
          jp:hasFailureHandling jp:ImmediateHalt .
      """
    When I invoke loadGraph() with the ontology data
    Then the graph should be parsed and stored in unctx context within 50ms
    And I should be able to findEntities("jp:TradingStrategy") returning 1 entity
    When I call findRelations("jp:HFTAlgorithm", "reg:mustComplyWith")
    Then I should receive regulatory compliance constraints
    When I invoke askGraph("Generate workflow for high-frequency trading under Volcker Rule compliance")
    Then the system should generate a complete CLI command workflow
    And the workflow should include pre-trade risk validation steps
    And the workflow should enforce position limits of $100M
    And the workflow should complete within 5 seconds as required by regulation
    And the natural language query accuracy should exceed 95%

  @enterprise @jpmorgan @byzantine-consensus @distributed
  Scenario: Multi-Jurisdiction Trading Command Generation with Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    Given I have distributed trading ontology nodes across regions:
      | Region    | Jurisdiction | Regulatory_Framework | Consensus_Required |
      | NY        | US           | SEC/FINRA           | true               |
      | London    | UK           | FCA                 | true               |
      | Singapore | APAC         | MAS                 | true               |
      | Frankfurt | EU           | ESMA/BaFin          | true               |
    And each node maintains compliance state with Byzantine consensus
    When I load multi-jurisdictional trading ontology across all nodes
    And up to 1/3 of nodes may exhibit Byzantine faults
    Then the system should maintain consensus on trading rules
    When I query "Generate cross-border derivatives trading workflow with MiFID II compliance"
    Then all non-faulty nodes should converge on identical workflow commands
    And the generated commands should respect all jurisdictional requirements
    And the consensus should be reached within 200ms across global nodes
    And security validation should pass with zero vulnerabilities

  @enterprise @jpmorgan @performance @stress-test
  Scenario: Real-Time Market Data Integration with Temporal Workflow Evolution
    Given I have a high-volume market data ontology with temporal relationships
    And the ontology processes 1M+ market updates per second
    And workflow patterns evolve based on market volatility states
    When the VIX volatility index exceeds 30 (high volatility state)
    Then the trading workflow ontology should automatically evolve
    And risk management constraints should tighten by 40%
    When I invoke loadGraph() with streaming market data ontology updates
    Then each graph update should complete within 10ms
    And findEntities("MarketCondition") should reflect current volatility regime
    When market conditions transition from "Normal" to "Stressed"
    Then workflow generation should adapt command parameters automatically
    And getValue("RiskMultiplier") should increase from 1.0 to 1.4
    And the temporal evolution should maintain consistency across 10,000+ concurrent workflows

  @enterprise @jpmorgan @quantum-superposition @advanced
  Scenario: Quantum Superposition States for Simultaneous Compliance Scenarios
    Given I have quantum-enabled ontology states for regulatory scenarios
    And the trading algorithm exists in superposition of compliant/non-compliant states
    When I load Schr√∂dinger ontology with simultaneous compliance states:
      """
      jp:TradingPosition a jp:QuantumState ;
          jp:inSuperposition [
              jp:state1 [ jp:compliantWith reg:VolckerRule ; jp:riskLevel "Low" ] ;
              jp:state2 [ jp:violates reg:ProprietaryTrading ; jp:riskLevel "High" ]
          ] ;
          jp:collapsesOnObservation jp:ComplianceCheck .
      """
    Then the ontology should maintain quantum coherence until measurement
    When I observe the compliance state via askGraph("Is this position Volcker compliant?")
    Then the superposition should collapse to deterministic compliance state
    And the workflow should generate appropriate command based on collapsed state
    And if collapsed to non-compliant, emergency halt commands should be generated
    And quantum decoherence should be prevented for less than 100ms observation window

  @enterprise @jpmorgan @edge-cases @error-handling
  Scenario Outline: Edge Cases in Trading Ontology Processing
    Given I have a trading ontology with potential data inconsistencies
    When I attempt to load ontology with <condition>
    Then the system should <expected_behavior>
    And appropriate error handling should be triggered
    And system stability should be maintained

    Examples:
      | condition                              | expected_behavior                    |
      | circular regulatory dependencies       | detect cycles and gracefully handle |
      | missing mandatory compliance fields    | throw OntologyValidationError        |
      | conflicting jurisdiction requirements  | resolve via precedence rules        |
      | malformed RDF/Turtle syntax          | provide detailed parsing errors      |
      | ontology size exceeding 1GB          | implement streaming processing       |
      | concurrent writes during market hours | maintain ACID transaction properties |

  @enterprise @jpmorgan @security @compliance
  Scenario: Security Validation and Audit Trail Generation
    Given I have secure trading ontology with encrypted sensitive data
    And all trading decisions require complete audit trails
    When I load classified trading strategy ontology
    Then all ontology access should be logged with timestamps
    And sensitive trading parameters should remain encrypted at rest
    When unauthorized users attempt to query proprietary algorithms
    Then access should be denied with security events logged
    When I export trading workflow commands via exportGraph()
    Then the export should exclude sensitive IP and comply with data governance
    And audit logs should capture full lineage of command generation
    And compliance officers should receive real-time notifications of policy violations
