# Microsoft Azure Service Mesh Configuration Ontology
# Ultra-sophisticated BDD scenarios for cloud-native infrastructure orchestration

Feature: Microsoft Azure Service Mesh Configuration from Infrastructure Ontology
  As a Microsoft Azure Solution Architect
  I want to generate service mesh configurations from infrastructure ontology
  So that I can orchestrate cloud-native applications with zero-trust security and observability

  Background:
    Given the Untology system is initialized with hyperscale Azure architecture
    And I have Microsoft Azure infrastructure ontology loaded from "ontologies/azure/service-mesh.ttl"
    And the ontology contains Istio, Linkerd, and Azure Service Mesh entities
    And multi-dimensional schema alignment is enabled for hybrid cloud scenarios

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @service-mesh @performance
  Scenario: Istio Service Mesh Configuration Generation for Azure Kubernetes Service
    Given I have an Azure service mesh ontology with the following structure:
      """
      @prefix az: <https://azure.microsoft.com/ontology/service-mesh#> .
      @prefix istio: <https://istio.io/ontology/mesh#> .
      @prefix k8s: <https://kubernetes.io/ontology#> .
      
      az:AKSCluster a k8s:Cluster ;
          az:hasRegion az:EastUS2 ;
          az:hasNodeCount "50"^^xsd:int ;
          az:hasServiceMesh istio:IstioMesh ;
          az:hasZeroTrustPolicies az:DefaultDeny ;
          az:hasObservability az:ApplicationInsights .
      
      istio:IstioMesh a az:ServiceMesh ;
          istio:hasGateway istio:IngressGateway, istio:EgressGateway ;
          istio:hasVirtualServices (
              az:PaymentService
              az:OrderService  
              az:InventoryService
              az:NotificationService
          ) ;
          istio:hasMTLS istio:Strict ;
          istio:hasTrafficPolicy [
              istio:loadBalancing "ROUND_ROBIN" ;
              istio:retryPolicy [ istio:attempts 3 ; istio:perTryTimeout "2s" ]
          ] .
      """
    When I invoke loadGraph() with the Azure service mesh ontology
    Then the graph should be parsed and stored in unctx context within 75ms
    And I should be able to findEntities("k8s:Cluster") returning 1 AKS cluster
    When I call findRelations("az:AKSCluster", "az:hasServiceMesh")
    Then I should receive Istio mesh configuration details
    When I invoke askGraph("Generate Istio configuration for microservices with mTLS and circuit breakers")
    Then the system should generate comprehensive Kubernetes YAML manifests
    And the configuration should include VirtualService definitions for all 4 services
    And mTLS should be configured in STRICT mode across all namespaces
    And circuit breakers should be configured with 3 retry attempts and 2s timeout
    And the natural language query accuracy should exceed 97%

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @multi-cluster @byzantine-consensus
  Scenario: Multi-Cluster Service Mesh Federation with Azure Arc
    Given I have distributed Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters across regions:
      | Cluster_Name      | Region           | Cloud_Provider | Arc_Enabled | Federation_Role |
      | aks-prod-east     | East US 2        | Azure         | true        | Primary         |
      | eks-prod-west     | US West          | AWS           | true        | Secondary       |
      | gke-prod-europe   | Europe West      | GCP           | true        | Secondary       |
      | on-prem-datacenter| On-Premises      | VMware        | true        | Edge            |
    And each cluster maintains service mesh state with Byzantine consensus
    And Azure Arc governance policies are enforced across all clusters
    When I load federated service mesh ontology across hybrid infrastructure
    And up to 1/3 of clusters may experience network partitions
    Then the system should maintain service mesh configuration consistency
    When I query "Deploy payment processing service across federated mesh with PCI compliance"
    Then all healthy clusters should converge on identical service configurations
    And PCI DSS policies should be enforced at mesh level with zero-trust networking
    And cross-cluster service discovery should maintain 99.99% availability
    And configuration propagation should complete within 30 seconds globally

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @performance @scaling
  Scenario: Auto-Scaling Service Mesh Based on Azure Monitor Metrics
    Given I have Azure service mesh with integrated Azure Monitor and Application Insights
    And the ontology contains scaling policies based on custom metrics
    And services handle 100,000+ requests per second during peak traffic
    When I define scaling ontology with temporal relationships:
      """
      az:ScalingPolicy a az:AutoScalingConfiguration ;
          az:basedOnMetric az:RequestLatencyP99 ;
          az:scaleOutThreshold "500"^^xsd:int ;

          az:cooldownPeriod "300"^^xsd:int ;
          az:evaluationFrequency "30"^^xsd:int .
      """
    Then loadGraph() should process scaling configuration within 25ms
    When application latency P99 exceeds 500ms threshold
    Then findEntities("az:ScalingPolicy") should trigger scale-out commands
    And new service instances should be provisioned within 60 seconds
    When traffic decreases and latency drops below 100ms
    Then scale-in workflow should execute after cooldown period
    And getValue("currentReplicas") should reflect actual running instances
    And scaling decisions should maintain SLA compliance during transitions

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @security @zero-trust
  Scenario: Zero-Trust Security Policy Generation from Compliance Ontology
    Given I have Azure service mesh with comprehensive zero-trust security model
    And the ontology defines security policies for different service tiers
    When I load zero-trust ontology with security classifications:
      """
      az:SecurityPolicy a az:ZeroTrustPolicy ;
          az:hasDefaultAction az:Deny ;

          az:accessibleBy ( az:OrderService az:BillingService ) ;
          az:requiresCompliance az:PCIDSSLevel1 .
      """
    Then the ontology should generate Istio AuthorizationPolicy resources
    When I invoke askGraph("Create zero-trust policies for PCI-compliant payment processing")
    Then generated policies should enforce deny-by-default networking
    And payment service should only accept mTLS connections from authorized services
    And all payment transactions should be logged to Azure Sentinel
    And compliance validation should pass automated PCI DSS scanning
    And security posture should achieve 100% policy coverage with zero exceptions

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @observability @performance
  Scenario: Distributed Tracing and Observability Pipeline Generation
    Given I have service mesh with comprehensive observability requirements
    And the ontology integrates Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Jaeger
    And system processes 50,000+ distributed traces per second
    When I define observability ontology with performance SLOs:
      """

          ] ;
          az:hasAlerting az:AzureMonitorAlerts .
      """
    Then loadGraph() should configure complete observability pipeline
    When distributed traces flow through the service mesh
    Then trace sampling should maintain statistical accuracy while reducing overhead
    And Application Insights should correlate traces with business metrics
    When SLO violations occur (latency > 200ms or error rate > 0.1%)
    Then automated alerts should trigger Azure Logic Apps for remediation
    And observability data should be retained per compliance requirements
    And dashboard generation should provide real-time service health visualization

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @edge-cases @disaster-recovery
  Scenario Outline: Disaster Recovery and Failover Scenarios
    Given I have multi-region Azure service mesh with disaster recovery capabilities
    And primary region experiences <disaster_type>
    When disaster detection mechanisms trigger failover procedures
    Then service mesh should automatically redirect traffic to <backup_region>
    And data consistency should be maintained during transition
    And RTO should not exceed <rto_requirement>
    And RPO should not exceed <rpo_requirement>

    Examples:
      | disaster_type           | backup_region | rto_requirement | rpo_requirement |
      | complete region outage  | West US 2     | 15 minutes      | 5 minutes       |
      | AKS cluster failure     | Central US    | 3 minutes       | 1 minute        |
      | service mesh corruption | East US       | 10 minutes      | 2 minutes       |
      | network partition       | South Central | 5 minutes       | 30 seconds      |

  @enterprise @microsoft @azure @integration @advanced
  Scenario: GitOps-Driven Service Mesh Configuration with Azure DevOps
    Given I have Azure service mesh integrated with Azure DevOps and ArgoCD
    And configuration changes follow GitOps methodology with approval workflows
    When developers commit service mesh configuration changes to Azure Repos
    Then Azure Pipelines should validate ontology syntax and security policies
    And ArgoCD should synchronize approved changes to target AKS clusters
    When ontology changes affect production service routing
    Then blue-green deployment strategies should be automatically configured
    And canary analysis should validate new configurations against SLOs
    And rollback procedures should be triggered if metrics degrade beyond thresholds
    And all configuration changes should maintain full audit trail for compliance
