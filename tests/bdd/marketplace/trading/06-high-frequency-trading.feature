Feature: High-Frequency Trading Algorithms
  As a quantitative trader
  I want to execute trades at microsecond speeds
  So that I can capitalize on market inefficiencies

  Background:
    Given the high-frequency trading system is operational
    And market data feeds are connected
    And risk management systems are active
    And latency is optimized to sub-millisecond levels

  Scenario: Ultra-low latency order execution
    Given I have a trading algorithm ready
    When a market opportunity is detected
    Then an order should be placed within 100 microseconds
    And the order should reach the exchange in under 500 microseconds
    And execution confirmation should be received immediately

  Scenario: Market maker algorithm
    Given I am running a market making strategy
    When bid-ask spreads widen beyond thresholds
    Then the algorithm should automatically place quotes
    And spreads should be competitive but profitable
    And positions should be balanced to minimize risk

  Scenario: Arbitrage opportunity detection
    Given multiple exchanges are being monitored
    When a price difference exceeds transaction costs
    Then the algorithm should detect the arbitrage
    And simultaneous buy/sell orders should be placed
    And profit should be locked in without market risk

  Scenario: Risk management circuit breakers
    Given trading algorithms are running
    When daily loss limits are approached
    Then automatic position reduction should trigger
    And all new orders should be blocked
    And risk managers should be immediately notified

  Scenario: Latency arbitrage strategy
    Given I have co-located servers at exchanges
    When market data shows price movements
    Then I should react before slower participants
    And orders should be routed to fastest execution venue
    And timing advantages should be maximized

  Scenario: Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) algorithm
    Given I need to execute a large order
    When I deploy VWAP algorithm
    Then the order should be broken into smaller pieces
    And execution should match historical volume patterns
    And market impact should be minimized

  Scenario: Statistical arbitrage pair trading
    Given I have identified correlated securities
    When price relationships deviate from historical norms
    Then long/short positions should be automatically taken
    And positions should converge back to mean
    And profit should be realized from mean reversion

  Scenario: High-frequency data processing
    Given market data is streaming at high rates
    When processing millions of data points per second
    Then all data should be processed without delays
    And system should maintain microsecond response times
    And no market opportunities should be missed due to latency

  Scenario: Algorithm performance monitoring
    Given HFT algorithms are running
    When monitoring system performance
    Then latency metrics should be tracked continuously
    And performance should be measured against benchmarks
    And alerts should trigger for any degradation

  Scenario: Regulatory compliance for HFT
    Given high-frequency trading is regulated
    When executing automated trades
    Then all trades should be properly logged
    And risk controls should be demonstrable
    And regulatory reporting should be automatic

  Scenario: Flash crash protection
    Given extreme market volatility occurs
    When prices move beyond circuit breakers
    Then algorithms should pause trading immediately
    And positions should be evaluated for risk
    And trading should resume only when safe

  Scenario: Cross-asset arbitrage
    Given I monitor multiple asset classes
    When correlations break down temporarily
    Then cross-asset opportunities should be identified
    And appropriate hedging instruments should be used
    And risk should be managed across asset classes
