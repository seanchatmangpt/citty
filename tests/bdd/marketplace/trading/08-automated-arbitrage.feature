Feature: Automated Arbitrage Systems
  As a sophisticated trader
  I want to automatically identify and execute arbitrage opportunities
  So that I can profit from price discrepancies across markets

  Background:
    Given multiple market venues are connected
    And real-time price feeds are available
    And execution systems are operational
    And risk management controls are active

  Scenario: Cross-exchange cryptocurrency arbitrage
    Given Bitcoin is trading on multiple exchanges
    When price differences exceed transaction costs
    Then the system should buy on lower-priced exchange
    And simultaneously sell on higher-priced exchange
    And profit should be locked in instantly

  Scenario: Geographic arbitrage detection
    Given the same asset trades in different regions
    When accounting for currency and transaction costs
    Then profitable arbitrage should be identified
    And orders should be placed in optimal sequence
    And currency risk should be hedged if necessary

  Scenario: Temporal arbitrage with futures
    Given spot and futures prices for the same asset
    When pricing relationships deviate from fair value
    Then arbitrage positions should be established
    And convergence should be profitable at expiration
    And carrying costs should be properly calculated

  Scenario: Triangular arbitrage in forex markets
    Given three currency pairs form a triangle
    When exchange rates create arbitrage opportunity
    Then the system should execute three trades rapidly
    And profit should be realized from rate discrepancies
    And execution should complete within seconds

  Scenario: ETF arbitrage mechanism
    Given an ETF and its underlying basket of stocks
    When ETF price deviates from net asset value
    Then authorized participants should arbitrage
    And creation/redemption process should be triggered
    And prices should converge to fair value

  Scenario: Statistical arbitrage pair trading
    Given historically correlated securities
    When correlations temporarily break down
    Then mean reversion positions should be taken
    And risk should be managed with stop-losses
    And positions should profit from convergence

  Scenario: Merger arbitrage opportunity
    Given a merger announcement with spread
    When deal completion probability can be assessed
    Then appropriate positions should be established
    And risk factors should be continuously monitored
    And positions should be adjusted based on news

  Scenario: Index arbitrage with baskets
    Given an index and its component stocks
    When index futures trade at premium or discount
    Then arbitrage basket should be constructed
    And execution should be coordinated across all components
    And tracking error should be minimized

  Scenario: Calendar spread arbitrage
    Given options or futures with different expirations
    When time decay creates pricing inefficiencies
    Then spread positions should be established
    And theta decay should work in favor of position
    And risk should be managed until convergence

  Scenario: Volatility arbitrage strategies
    Given implied volatility differs from realized volatility
    When statistical models indicate mispricing
    Then delta-neutral positions should be established
    And volatility exposure should be the primary risk
    And profits should come from volatility mean reversion

  Scenario: Cross-asset arbitrage opportunities
    Given related assets across different classes
    When traditional relationships break down
    Then cross-asset positions should be considered
    And correlation risk should be properly managed
    And fundamental relationships should be validated

  Scenario: Arbitrage execution optimization
    Given multiple arbitrage opportunities simultaneously
    When capital and risk limits constrain positions
    Then opportunities should be ranked by risk-adjusted return
    And optimal portfolio should be constructed
    And execution should be prioritized accordingly

  Scenario: Arbitrage performance attribution
    Given various arbitrage strategies are running
    When analyzing overall performance
    Then returns should be attributed to specific strategies
    And risk metrics should be calculated for each approach
    And resource allocation should be optimized
