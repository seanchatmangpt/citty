Feature: Multi-Party Escrow Transactions
  As a marketplace participant
  I want secure escrow services for high-value transactions
  So that all parties are protected during complex deals

  Background:
    Given the escrow system is operational and secure
    And multiple parties can participate in transactions
    And dispute resolution mechanisms are available
    And regulatory compliance is maintained

  Scenario: Basic two-party escrow transaction
    Given a buyer wants to purchase from a seller
    When they agree to use escrow services
    Then funds should be held securely by escrow agent
    And goods should be delivered to buyer
    And funds should be released upon confirmation

  Scenario: Multi-party escrow with intermediaries
    Given a complex transaction involves multiple parties
    When all parties agree to escrow terms
    Then each party's obligations should be clearly defined
    And funds should be distributed according to agreement
    And all conditions must be met before release

  Scenario: Smart contract escrow automation
    Given escrow terms are encoded in smart contract
    When predetermined conditions are met
    Then funds should be released automatically
    And transaction should complete without manual intervention
    And all parties should receive confirmation

  Scenario: Dispute resolution in escrow
    Given an escrow transaction has a dispute
    When parties cannot resolve issues directly
    Then a neutral arbitrator should be assigned
    And evidence should be collected from all parties
    And binding decision should be made within timeframe

  Scenario: Partial release escrow for milestone payments
    Given a project-based transaction with milestones
    When each milestone is completed and verified
    Then partial funds should be released accordingly
    And remaining funds should stay in escrow
    And final payment should be released on completion

  Scenario: International escrow with currency conversion
    Given parties are in different countries
    When they use different currencies
    Then escrow should handle currency conversion
    And exchange rates should be locked at agreement time
    And all parties should understand final amounts

  Scenario: Real estate escrow transaction
    Given a property purchase transaction
    When buyer and seller agree to terms
    Then earnest money should be held in escrow
    And title search and inspections should be completed
    And closing should transfer ownership and funds

  Scenario: Escrow fraud prevention
    Given potential fraudulent activity is detected
    When suspicious patterns are identified
    Then transactions should be flagged for review
    And additional verification should be required
    And funds should remain secured until cleared

  Scenario: Escrow service fee calculation
    Given various types of escrow transactions
    When calculating service fees
    Then fees should be transparent and reasonable
    And fee structure should be clearly communicated
    And payment responsibility should be predetermined

  Scenario: High-value escrow with enhanced security
    Given an escrow transaction exceeds $1 million
    When additional security measures are required
    Then multi-signature authorization should be implemented
    And enhanced due diligence should be performed
    And insurance coverage should be verified

  Scenario: Escrow transaction monitoring and reporting
    Given escrow transactions are being processed
    When monitoring for compliance and performance
    Then all transactions should be tracked in real-time
    And reports should be generated for stakeholders
    And audit trails should be maintained

  Scenario: Emergency escrow release procedures
    Given an emergency situation arises
    When normal release procedures cannot be followed
    Then emergency protocols should be activated
    And appropriate authorities should be notified
    And funds should be handled according to legal requirements
