  given: async () => {
    // Setup test data
  },
  when: async () => {
    // Execute search

## 🎭 Gherkin Features

Each `.feature` file follows standard Gherkin syntax:

```gherkin
Feature: Product Listing and Discovery
  As a marketplace user
  I want to discover products efficiently
  So that I can find what I need to purchase

  Scenario: Basic product search
    Given I am on the marketplace homepage
    When I search for "electronics"
    Then I should see relevant electronics products
    And products should be sorted by relevance
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Support

These BDD scenarios validate patterns that support:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Event-driven, loosely coupled services
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Scalable, resilient, observable systems
- **API-First Design**: Well-defined interfaces and contracts
- **Security by Design**: Built-in security controls and monitoring
- **Compliance Ready**: Automated regulatory compliance checking

## 📚 Documentation

Each pattern includes comprehensive documentation:
- **Business Value**: Why the pattern is important
- **Technical Implementation**: How to implement the pattern
- **Security Considerations**: Security requirements and controls
- **Performance Requirements**: SLA and performance expectations
- **Compliance Mapping**: Which regulations the pattern addresses

## 🤝 Contributing
