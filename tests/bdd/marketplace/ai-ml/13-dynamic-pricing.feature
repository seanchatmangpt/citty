Feature: Dynamic Pricing Algorithms
  As a marketplace seller or operator
  I want automated pricing optimization
  So that revenue and competitiveness are maximized

  Background:
    Given the dynamic pricing system is operational
    And market data is being collected in real-time
    And pricing algorithms are trained and deployed
    And business rules and constraints are configured

  Scenario: Demand-based pricing adjustment
    Given product demand is fluctuating
    When demand increases significantly
    Then prices should be adjusted upward dynamically
    And price increases should be gradual and reasonable
    And customer price sensitivity should be considered

  Scenario: Competitive pricing analysis
    Given competitor prices are being monitored
    When competitor price changes are detected
    Then our prices should be adjusted accordingly
    And competitive positioning should be maintained
    And price wars should be avoided through intelligent logic

  Scenario: Inventory-based pricing optimization
    Given current inventory levels
    When stock levels are high or low
    Then prices should be adjusted to optimize turnover
    And clearance pricing should be applied to excess inventory
    And premium pricing should apply to scarce items

  Scenario: Time-based pricing strategies
    Given different time periods have different demand patterns
    When implementing time-based pricing
    Then peak hours should have higher prices
    And off-peak periods should have promotional pricing
    And seasonal adjustments should be applied automatically

  Scenario: Customer segment pricing
    Given different customer segments have different price sensitivities
    When serving prices to customers
    Then pricing should be tailored to customer segments
    And loyalty customers should receive preferential pricing
    And new customers should receive competitive introductory prices

  Scenario: Bundle pricing optimization
    Given products can be sold individually or as bundles
    When optimizing bundle prices
    Then bundle discounts should increase total cart value
    And individual item margins should be balanced
    And cross-selling opportunities should be maximized

  Scenario: Geographic pricing variations
    Given customers from different regions
    When setting regional prices
    Then local market conditions should be considered
    And purchasing power differences should be factored in
    And shipping costs should be appropriately reflected

  Scenario: A/B testing for pricing strategies
    Given multiple pricing strategies to test
    When running pricing experiments
    Then different approaches should be tested simultaneously
    And statistical significance should be measured
    And winning strategies should be scaled automatically

  Scenario: Price elasticity analysis
    Given historical sales and pricing data
    When analyzing price sensitivity
    Then optimal price points should be identified
    And revenue impact of price changes should be predicted
    And pricing recommendations should be generated

  Scenario: Real-time price optimization
    Given market conditions are changing rapidly
    When external factors affect pricing
    Then prices should be updated in near real-time
    And price changes should be communicated appropriately
    And system performance should handle high-frequency updates

  Scenario: Promotional pricing automation
    Given promotional campaigns and events
    When running limited-time offers
    Then promotional prices should be applied automatically
    And discount schedules should be managed efficiently
    And promotion effectiveness should be measured

  Scenario: Price monitoring and alerts
    Given automated pricing is in effect
    When monitoring pricing performance
    Then pricing anomalies should be detected
    And business rule violations should trigger alerts
    And manual override capabilities should be available

  Scenario: Revenue optimization across product portfolio
    Given a diverse product catalog
    When optimizing overall portfolio performance
    Then cross-product effects should be considered
    And portfolio-level revenue should be maximized
    And individual product performance should be balanced
