Feature: Real-time Recommendation Engines
  As a marketplace user
  I want personalized product recommendations
  So that I can discover relevant products efficiently

  Background:
    Given the recommendation engine is operational
    And user behavior data is being collected
    And machine learning models are trained
    And real-time processing is available

  Scenario: Personalized product recommendations
    Given I have a browsing and purchase history
    When I visit the marketplace homepage
    Then I should see recommendations tailored to my preferences
    And recommendations should be updated in real-time
    And relevance scores should be above 80%

  Scenario: Collaborative filtering recommendations
    Given users with similar purchase patterns exist
    When generating recommendations for a user
    Then items liked by similar users should be suggested
    And the similarity algorithm should be accurate
    And cold start problems should be handled gracefully

  Scenario: Content-based filtering
    Given product features and user preferences
    When recommending products
    Then items with similar attributes should be suggested
    And feature weighting should reflect user importance
    And recommendations should explain why items were chosen

  Scenario: Hybrid recommendation approach
    Given both collaborative and content-based algorithms
    When generating recommendations
    Then multiple approaches should be combined intelligently
    And the ensemble should outperform individual methods
    And recommendation diversity should be maintained

  Scenario: Real-time behavior adaptation
    Given I am currently browsing products
    When I click on or purchase an item
    Then recommendations should update immediately
    And my session context should influence suggestions
    And short-term interests should be weighted appropriately

  Scenario: Cross-selling recommendations
    Given I have items in my shopping cart
    When viewing cart or checkout pages
    Then complementary products should be suggested
    And bundle recommendations should be relevant
    And upselling opportunities should be identified

  Scenario: Seasonal and trending recommendations
    Given current market trends and seasonal patterns
    When generating recommendations
    Then trending products should be given higher weight
    And seasonal relevance should be considered
    And viral or popular items should be surfaced

  Scenario: Context-aware recommendations
    Given my location, time, and device information
    When browsing the marketplace
    Then context should influence recommendations
    And mobile vs desktop usage should be considered
    And local availability should be factored in

  Scenario: Recommendation explanation and transparency
    Given AI-generated recommendations
    When displaying suggestions to users
    Then reasons for recommendations should be provided
    And users should understand why items were suggested
    And transparency should build trust in the system

  Scenario: A/B testing for recommendation algorithms
    Given multiple recommendation strategies
    When testing algorithm effectiveness
    Then different approaches should be compared
    And statistical significance should be measured
    And winning strategies should be automatically deployed

  Scenario: Recommendation performance optimization
    Given high traffic loads on the recommendation system
    When serving recommendations at scale
    Then response times should be under 100ms
    And system should handle thousands of concurrent requests
    And recommendation quality should not degrade under load

  Scenario: Privacy-preserving recommendations
    Given user privacy concerns and regulations
    When generating personalized recommendations
    Then personal data should be protected appropriately
    And anonymization techniques should be used
    And users should control their recommendation preferences

  Scenario: Recommendation bias detection and mitigation
    Given potential algorithmic bias in recommendations
    When monitoring recommendation fairness
    Then bias should be detected and measured
    And mitigation strategies should be implemented
    And diverse recommendations should be ensured
