Feature: Customer Behavior Prediction
  As a marketplace analyst
  I want to predict customer behavior patterns
  So that I can optimize user experience and business outcomes

  Background:
    Given customer behavior data is being collected
    And machine learning models are trained and deployed
    And prediction services are operational
    And behavioral analytics are available

  Scenario: Purchase intent prediction
    Given customer browsing patterns and history
    When analyzing current session behavior
    Then purchase likelihood should be calculated
    And high-intent customers should be identified
    And targeted interventions should be triggered

  Scenario: Churn risk prediction
    Given customer engagement and transaction history
    When evaluating customer loyalty
    Then churn probability should be predicted
    And at-risk customers should be flagged
    And retention campaigns should be initiated proactively

  Scenario: Lifetime value prediction
    Given customer acquisition and transaction data
    When onboarding new customers
    Then customer lifetime value should be estimated
    And high-value customers should be prioritized
    And acquisition spending should be optimized

  Scenario: Product preference prediction
    Given past purchase and browsing behavior
    When customer visits the marketplace
    Then product preferences should be predicted
    And inventory planning should consider demand forecasts
    And personalization should be enhanced

  Scenario: Seasonal behavior pattern recognition
    Given historical customer behavior across seasons
    When planning for upcoming seasons
    Then seasonal patterns should be identified
    And demand fluctuations should be predicted
    And inventory and marketing should be adjusted

  Scenario: Cart abandonment prediction
    Given shopping cart behavior patterns
    When customers add items to cart
    Then abandonment risk should be assessed
    And timely interventions should be deployed
    And conversion rates should be improved

  Scenario: Cross-selling opportunity prediction
    Given customer purchase history and product relationships
    When customers make purchases
    Then cross-selling opportunities should be identified
    And relevant products should be recommended
    And basket size should be increased

  Scenario: Price sensitivity analysis
    Given customer response to pricing changes
    When setting prices for different segments
    Then price sensitivity should be predicted
    And optimal pricing strategies should be recommended
    And revenue should be maximized

  Scenario: Channel preference prediction
    Given customer interaction across multiple channels
    When engaging with customers
    Then preferred communication channels should be identified
    And channel strategy should be personalized
    And engagement rates should be optimized

  Scenario: Return behavior prediction
    Given historical return patterns
    When processing orders
    Then return likelihood should be predicted
    And high-return-risk orders should be flagged
    And preventive measures should be implemented

  Scenario: Fraud propensity scoring
    Given customer behavior and transaction patterns
    When assessing fraud risk
    Then fraud propensity scores should be calculated
    And suspicious customers should be monitored
    And preventive measures should be applied

  Scenario: Engagement pattern analysis
    Given customer interaction data
    When analyzing user engagement
    Then engagement patterns should be identified
    And optimal timing for communications should be determined
    And engagement strategies should be personalized

  Scenario: Predictive model performance monitoring
    Given deployed prediction models
    When monitoring model accuracy
    Then prediction performance should be tracked
    And model drift should be detected
    And retraining should be triggered when necessary
