Feature: Fraud Detection Systems
  As a marketplace operator
  I want to detect and prevent fraudulent activities
  So that legitimate users and the platform are protected

  Background:
    Given the fraud detection system is operational
    And machine learning models are trained on historical data
    And real-time monitoring is active
    And response mechanisms are in place

  Scenario: Real-time transaction fraud detection
    Given a user is making a purchase
    When the transaction is processed
    Then fraud risk should be assessed in real-time
    And high-risk transactions should be flagged immediately
    And legitimate transactions should proceed without delay

  Scenario: Account takeover detection
    Given unusual login patterns are detected
    When a user attempts to access their account
    Then behavioral biometrics should be analyzed
    And additional verification should be required if suspicious
    And the account should be protected from unauthorized access

  Scenario: Credit card fraud prevention
    Given credit card information is being used
    When processing payment
    Then card validation checks should be performed
    And velocity checks should detect unusual spending patterns
    And suspicious transactions should be declined or held

  Scenario: Fake seller account detection
    Given new seller registrations
    When evaluating seller legitimacy
    Then identity verification should be thorough
    And business documentation should be validated
    And suspicious sellers should be prevented from listing

  Scenario: Review and rating fraud detection
    Given product reviews and ratings
    When analyzing review authenticity
    Then fake reviews should be identified
    And review patterns should be analyzed for manipulation
    And fraudulent reviews should be removed

  Scenario: Chargeback fraud prevention
    Given past chargeback patterns
    When processing orders from risky customers
    Then chargeback probability should be predicted
    And high-risk orders should require additional verification
    And legitimate merchants should be protected

  Scenario: Identity theft protection
    Given personal information is being used
    When creating accounts or making purchases
    Then identity verification should be comprehensive
    And suspicious identity usage should be flagged
    And stolen identity usage should be prevented

  Scenario: Promotional abuse detection
    Given discount codes and promotions
    When users attempt to claim offers
    Then abuse patterns should be detected
    And multiple account creation should be prevented
    And promotional budgets should be protected

  Scenario: Machine learning model adaptation
    Given new fraud patterns emerge
    When the system detects novel attack vectors
    Then models should adapt and learn automatically
    And detection accuracy should improve over time
    And false positive rates should be minimized

  Scenario: Cross-platform fraud correlation
    Given fraud attempts across multiple channels
    When analyzing user behavior patterns
    Then suspicious activities should be correlated
    And fraudsters should be identified across platforms
    And coordinated response should be implemented

  Scenario: Behavioral analytics for fraud detection
    Given user behavior patterns
    When monitoring for anomalies
    Then deviations from normal behavior should be detected
    And risk scores should be calculated dynamically
    And appropriate interventions should be triggered

  Scenario: Fraud investigation workflow
    Given a transaction is flagged as potentially fraudulent
    When initiating investigation
    Then evidence should be collected automatically
    And investigation should be prioritized by risk level
    And decisions should be made within acceptable timeframes

  Scenario: Regulatory compliance for fraud prevention
    Given anti-fraud regulations and requirements
    When implementing fraud prevention measures
    Then regulatory standards should be met
    And reporting requirements should be fulfilled
    And audit trails should be maintained
