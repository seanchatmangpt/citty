Feature: Event-Driven Microservices
  As a system architect
  I want loosely coupled microservices communicating via events
  So that the system is scalable, resilient, and maintainable

  Background:
    Given microservices architecture is implemented
    And event streaming platform is operational
    And service discovery is configured
    And monitoring and observability are in place

  Scenario: Asynchronous event publishing
    Given a microservice needs to notify other services
    When a business event occurs
    Then the event should be published to the event stream
    And event schema should be validated
    And publishing should be confirmed

  Scenario: Event consumption and processing
    Given services subscribe to relevant events
    When events are published to streams
    Then subscribed services should receive events
    And event processing should be idempotent
    And processing failures should be handled

  Scenario: Event sourcing implementation
    Given business state changes need to be tracked
    When implementing event sourcing
    Then all changes should be stored as events
    And current state should be derived from events
    And event replay should be possible

  Scenario: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
    Given read and write operations have different requirements
    When implementing CQRS pattern
    Then command and query models should be separated
    And read models should be optimized for queries
    And eventual consistency should be managed

  Scenario: Saga pattern for distributed transactions
    Given transactions span multiple microservices
    When implementing distributed transactions
    Then saga orchestration should coordinate services
    And compensating actions should be defined
    And transaction state should be managed

  Scenario: Service mesh integration
    Given microservices need service-to-service communication
    When implementing service mesh
    Then traffic routing should be managed
    And security policies should be enforced
    And observability should be enhanced

  Scenario: Event stream processing
    Given real-time event processing is required
    When processing event streams
    Then stream processing should be performant
    And event ordering should be maintained where needed
    And processing lag should be monitored

  Scenario: Schema evolution and compatibility
    Given event schemas may change over time
    When evolving event structures
    Then backward compatibility should be maintained
    And schema registry should manage versions
    And consumers should handle schema changes

  Scenario: Dead letter queue handling
    Given some events may fail processing
    When event processing fails repeatedly
    Then events should be moved to dead letter queues
    And failed events should be analyzed
    And reprocessing mechanisms should be available

  Scenario: Event replay and reprocessing
    Given historical events need to be reprocessed
    When implementing event replay
    Then events should be replayable from any point
    And replay should not affect current operations
    And data consistency should be maintained

  Scenario: Distributed tracing for event flows
    Given events flow through multiple services
    When tracing event processing
    Then distributed traces should span services
    And event correlation should be maintained
    And performance bottlenecks should be identified

  Scenario: Event-driven autoscaling
    Given event processing load varies
    When monitoring event queue depths
    Then services should scale based on event volume
    And scaling decisions should be automated
    And resource utilization should be optimized

  Scenario: Cross-service data consistency
    Given data is distributed across services
    When maintaining data consistency
    Then eventual consistency patterns should be used
    And consistency checks should be implemented
    And data synchronization should be reliable
