Feature: API Gateway Orchestration
  As an enterprise architect
  I want centralized API management and orchestration
  So that API access is secure, efficient, and well-governed

  Background:
    Given the API gateway is operational
    And API policies are configured
    And authentication and authorization are set up
    And monitoring and analytics are enabled

  Scenario: API authentication and authorization
    Given multiple client applications need API access
    When clients make API requests
    Then authentication should be verified
    And authorization should be enforced based on roles
    And access tokens should be validated

  Scenario: Rate limiting and throttling
    Given API usage needs to be controlled
    When clients exceed allowed request rates
    Then requests should be throttled appropriately
    And rate limit headers should be returned
    And clients should be notified of limits

  Scenario: API request routing and load balancing
    Given multiple backend services handle requests
    When routing API requests
    Then requests should be routed to appropriate services
    And load should be distributed evenly
    And service health should be considered

  Scenario: Request and response transformation
    Given clients and services may use different data formats
    When processing API requests
    Then request formats should be transformed as needed
    And response formats should be standardized
    And backward compatibility should be maintained

  Scenario: API versioning management
    Given APIs evolve over time
    When managing multiple API versions
    Then version routing should be accurate
    And deprecated versions should be managed
    And migration paths should be provided

  Scenario: Circuit breaker pattern implementation
    Given backend services may become unavailable
    When service failures are detected
    Then circuit breakers should prevent cascade failures
    And fallback responses should be provided
    And service recovery should be detected

  Scenario: API caching and performance optimization
    Given frequent requests for similar data
    When implementing caching strategies
    Then appropriate responses should be cached
    And cache invalidation should be managed
    And performance should be improved

  Scenario: API analytics and monitoring
    Given need for API usage insights
    When collecting API metrics
    Then usage patterns should be tracked
    And performance metrics should be monitored
    And alerts should be generated for issues

  Scenario: API security scanning and protection
    Given APIs face various security threats
    When processing API requests
    Then malicious requests should be detected
    And SQL injection attempts should be blocked
    And DDoS attacks should be mitigated

  Scenario: API documentation and discovery
    Given developers need API information
    When accessing API documentation
    Then comprehensive documentation should be available
    And interactive testing should be provided
    And API discovery should be facilitated

  Scenario: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
    Given web applications need cross-origin access
    When handling CORS requests
    Then appropriate CORS headers should be set
    And origin validation should be performed
    And preflight requests should be handled

  Scenario: API composition and orchestration
    Given complex operations require multiple service calls
    When implementing API composition
    Then multiple backend calls should be orchestrated
    And partial failures should be handled gracefully
    And response aggregation should be performed

  Scenario: Webhook management and delivery
    Given clients need real-time notifications
    When managing webhook subscriptions
    Then webhook delivery should be reliable
    And retry mechanisms should be implemented
    And delivery status should be tracked
