Feature: Supply Chain Management
  As a supply chain manager
  I want end-to-end visibility and control of the supply chain
  So that operations are optimized and risks are minimized

  Background:
    Given the supply chain management system is operational
    And supplier networks are connected
    And logistics partners are integrated
    And IoT sensors and tracking are deployed

  Scenario: End-to-end supply chain visibility
    Given products move through complex supply chains
    When tracking shipments from origin to destination
    Then real-time location should be available
    And status updates should be provided automatically
    And stakeholders should have appropriate visibility

  Scenario: Supplier performance management
    Given multiple suppliers provide similar products
    When evaluating supplier performance
    Then key metrics should be tracked automatically
    And scorecards should be generated regularly
    And poor performers should be flagged for action

  Scenario: Demand forecasting and planning
    Given historical sales and market data
    When planning future inventory needs
    Then demand should be forecasted accurately
    And seasonal patterns should be considered
    And supply planning should be optimized

  Scenario: Inventory optimization across locations
    Given inventory is held at multiple locations
    When optimizing stock levels
    Then optimal quantities should be calculated
    And reorder points should be automated
    And excess inventory should be redistributed

  Scenario: Supplier risk assessment
    Given suppliers face various operational risks
    When monitoring supplier stability
    Then financial health should be assessed
    And operational risks should be identified
    And contingency plans should be prepared

  Scenario: Procurement automation
    Given recurring purchase requirements
    When demand triggers procurement
    Then sourcing should be automated where possible
    And competitive bidding should be facilitated
    And contract terms should be optimized

  Scenario: Logistics optimization
    Given multiple shipping and delivery options
    When planning shipments
    Then routes should be optimized for cost and speed
    And carrier performance should be considered
    And consolidation opportunities should be identified

  Scenario: Quality management integration
    Given quality requirements for products
    When receiving goods from suppliers
    Then quality inspections should be systematic
    And non-conforming products should be managed
    And quality trends should be tracked

  Scenario: Sustainability and compliance tracking
    Given environmental and social responsibility goals
    When managing supply chain operations
    Then sustainability metrics should be tracked
    And compliance requirements should be monitored
    And reporting should be automated

  Scenario: Supply chain disruption management
    Given potential disruptions to supply chain
    When disruptions occur or are predicted
    Then alternative sources should be identified
    And impact should be assessed quickly
    And mitigation plans should be executed

  Scenario: Collaborative planning with suppliers
    Given need for coordinated planning
    When sharing demand forecasts with suppliers
    Then collaborative planning should be facilitated
    And information sharing should be secure
    And mutual benefits should be optimized

  Scenario: Supply chain finance optimization
    Given working capital optimization opportunities
    When managing payment terms and financing
    Then cash flow should be optimized
    And financing options should be evaluated
    And supplier relationships should be strengthened

  Scenario: Blockchain integration for traceability
    Given need for immutable supply chain records
    When implementing blockchain technology
    Then product provenance should be verifiable
    And supply chain integrity should be ensured
    And trust should be enhanced among participants
