Feature: Multi-tenant Architecture
  As a marketplace platform provider
  I want to support multiple tenants efficiently
  So that each organization can operate independently while sharing resources

  Background:
    Given the multi-tenant platform is operational
    And tenant isolation mechanisms are in place
    And resource allocation is optimized
    And security boundaries are enforced

  Scenario: Tenant data isolation
    Given multiple tenants share the platform
    When accessing tenant-specific data
    Then data should be completely isolated between tenants
    And cross-tenant data leakage should be prevented
    And tenant data should be encrypted appropriately

  Scenario: Custom branding and white-labeling
    Given each tenant wants their own brand identity
    When configuring tenant appearance
    Then custom logos and color schemes should be applied
    And domain names should be customizable
    And branding should be consistent across all pages

  Scenario: Tenant-specific configuration
    Given different tenants have different requirements
    When configuring platform features
    Then feature sets should be customizable per tenant
    And business rules should be tenant-specific
    And workflows should be configurable independently

  Scenario: Scalable resource allocation
    Given tenants have varying resource needs
    When allocating computing resources
    Then resources should scale based on tenant usage
    And resource limits should be enforced
    And cost allocation should be accurate

  Scenario: Tenant onboarding automation
    Given new tenants need to be onboarded
    When a new tenant signs up
    Then tenant infrastructure should be provisioned automatically
    And initial configuration should be completed
    And tenant users should be able to access immediately

  Scenario: Database multi-tenancy patterns
    Given tenant data needs to be stored efficiently
    When implementing data storage
    Then appropriate multi-tenancy pattern should be used
    And query performance should be optimized
    And data backup and recovery should be tenant-aware

  Scenario: API rate limiting per tenant
    Given tenants make API calls at different rates
    When processing API requests
    Then rate limits should be applied per tenant
    And fair usage should be enforced
    And abuse should be prevented

  Scenario: Tenant-specific integrations
    Given tenants use different third-party systems
    When configuring integrations
    Then each tenant should have independent integrations
    And integration credentials should be isolated
    And integration failures should not affect other tenants

  Scenario: Compliance and regulatory requirements
    Given tenants may have different compliance needs
    When handling regulated data
    Then appropriate compliance controls should be applied
    And audit trails should be tenant-specific
    And regulatory reporting should be isolated

  Scenario: Tenant billing and metering
    Given tenants consume resources differently
    When calculating usage and billing
    Then usage should be metered accurately per tenant
    And billing should be generated automatically
    And cost breakdown should be detailed

  Scenario: Performance isolation
    Given tenant workloads may vary significantly
    When high-usage tenants consume resources
    Then performance should be isolated between tenants
    And noisy neighbor effects should be minimized
    And SLA guarantees should be maintained

  Scenario: Tenant backup and disaster recovery
    Given each tenant needs data protection
    When implementing backup strategies
    Then backups should be isolated per tenant
    And recovery should be tenant-specific
    And RTO/RPO objectives should be met

  Scenario: Cross-tenant analytics and reporting
    Given platform operators need insights
    When generating analytics
    Then aggregated metrics should be available
    And tenant anonymity should be preserved where required
    And performance trends should be identifiable
