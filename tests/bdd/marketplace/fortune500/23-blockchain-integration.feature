Feature: Blockchain Integration
  As a Fortune 500 technology executive
  I want blockchain integration for transparency and trust
  So that our marketplace provides immutable transaction records and smart contract automation

  Background:
    Given enterprise blockchain infrastructure is operational
    And smart contract platforms are deployed
    And consensus mechanisms are configured
    And regulatory compliance is maintained

  Scenario: Smart contract automation for transactions
    Given complex transaction terms need automation
    When implementing smart contracts
    Then contract terms should be encoded accurately
    And execution should be automatic when conditions are met
    And contract state should be transparent

  Scenario: Immutable transaction ledger
    Given the need for tamper-proof transaction records
    When recording marketplace transactions
    Then all transactions should be stored on blockchain
    And transaction history should be immutable
    And audit trails should be permanent

  Scenario: Supply chain traceability on blockchain
    Given products have complex supply chains
    When tracking product provenance
    Then every step should be recorded on blockchain
    And authenticity should be verifiable
    And counterfeit products should be detectable

  Scenario: Decentralized identity management
    Given identity verification needs across organizations
    When implementing identity solutions
    Then self-sovereign identity should be supported
    And identity verification should be decentralized
    And privacy should be preserved

  Scenario: Cross-border payments with cryptocurrency
    Given international payments face friction
    When processing cross-border transactions
    Then cryptocurrency payments should be accepted
    And settlement should be faster than traditional methods
    And regulatory compliance should be maintained

  Scenario: Tokenization of assets and rewards
    Given the need for innovative incentive mechanisms
    When implementing loyalty and rewards programs
    Then assets should be tokenized appropriately
    And tokens should have real utility
    And token economics should be sustainable

  Scenario: Decentralized marketplace governance
    Given stakeholder participation in governance
    When making platform decisions
    Then governance tokens should enable voting
    And decisions should be transparent
    And stakeholder interests should be represented

  Scenario: Oracle integration for external data
    Given smart contracts need external data
    When connecting to off-chain data sources
    Then reliable oracles should provide data
    And data authenticity should be verified
    And oracle failures should be handled

  Scenario: Multi-chain interoperability
    Given different blockchain networks exist
    When operating across multiple chains
    Then cross-chain communication should be seamless
    And asset transfers should be secure
    And network effects should be maximized

  Scenario: Blockchain performance optimization
    Given high transaction volumes on the marketplace
    When processing blockchain transactions
    Then throughput should meet business requirements
    And transaction costs should be reasonable
    And scalability solutions should be implemented

  Scenario: Regulatory compliance for blockchain operations
    Given varying blockchain regulations globally
    When operating blockchain systems
    Then compliance requirements should be met
    And reporting should be accurate
    And regulatory changes should be adapted to

  Scenario: Energy-efficient consensus mechanisms
    Given environmental sustainability concerns
    When choosing consensus mechanisms
    Then energy consumption should be minimized
    And carbon footprint should be reduced
    And sustainability goals should be met

  Scenario: Private blockchain for sensitive data
    Given some data requires privacy
    When handling confidential information
    Then private blockchain networks should be used
    And access controls should be enforced
    And data confidentiality should be maintained
