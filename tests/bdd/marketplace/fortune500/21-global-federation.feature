Feature: Global Marketplace Federation
  As a Fortune 500 enterprise
  I want to operate a federated marketplace across global regions
  So that I can serve customers worldwide while meeting local requirements

  Background:
    Given global marketplace federation is operational
    And regional marketplaces are connected
    And cross-border regulations are configured
    And global governance policies are in place

  Scenario: Multi-region marketplace synchronization
    Given marketplaces operate in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific
    When product catalogs are updated in one region
    Then changes should propagate to appropriate other regions
    And regional customizations should be preserved
    And synchronization conflicts should be resolved

  Scenario: Global customer identity federation
    Given customers may shop across multiple regions
    When a customer logs in to any regional marketplace
    Then their identity should be recognized globally
    And preferences should be available across regions
    And privacy regulations should be respected

  Scenario: Cross-border transaction processing
    Given customers purchase from sellers in different countries
    When processing international transactions
    Then appropriate payment methods should be available
    And currency conversions should be handled accurately
    And tax calculations should consider all jurisdictions

  Scenario: Regional compliance and localization
    Given different regions have different regulations
    When operating in each region
    Then local compliance requirements should be met
    And content should be localized appropriately
    And regional business practices should be followed

  Scenario: Global supply chain orchestration
    Given suppliers and fulfillment centers worldwide
    When optimizing order fulfillment
    Then global inventory should be visible
    And optimal fulfillment locations should be selected
    And cross-border shipping should be coordinated

  Scenario: Federated search and discovery
    Given products are distributed across regional marketplaces
    When customers search globally
    Then search should span multiple regions
    And results should be ranked appropriately
    And regional availability should be indicated

  Scenario: Global seller onboarding and management
    Given sellers want to reach global markets
    When sellers register to sell internationally
    Then compliance requirements should be validated per region
    And seller verification should meet local standards
    And cross-border selling should be facilitated

  Scenario: Multi-currency pricing and hedging
    Given operations in multiple currencies
    When managing pricing across regions
    Then currency risks should be hedged appropriately
    And pricing should be consistent globally
    And exchange rate fluctuations should be managed

  Scenario: Global customer service coordination
    Given customers need support across time zones
    When providing customer service
    Then support should be available 24/7 globally
    And escalations should be routed appropriately
    And service quality should be consistent

  Scenario: Federated analytics and reporting
    Given business intelligence needs across regions
    When generating global reports
    Then data should be aggregated from all regions
    And regional insights should be provided
    And global KPIs should be calculated

  Scenario: Cross-border dispute resolution
    Given disputes may involve parties in different countries
    When handling international disputes
    Then appropriate jurisdiction should be determined
    And dispute resolution should follow international protocols
    And enforcement should be coordinated globally

  Scenario: Global brand consistency
    Given the need for unified brand experience
    When customers interact with any regional marketplace
    Then brand standards should be maintained
    And messaging should be consistent globally
    And local adaptations should align with global brand
