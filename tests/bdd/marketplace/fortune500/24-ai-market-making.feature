Feature: AI-Driven Market Making
  As a Fortune 500 financial services executive
  I want AI-powered market making capabilities
  So that liquidity is optimized and spreads are competitive across all products

  Background:
    Given AI market making algorithms are deployed
    And real-time market data is available
    And risk management systems are active
    And regulatory compliance is maintained

  Scenario: Dynamic spread optimization
    Given market conditions are constantly changing
    When setting bid-ask spreads
    Then AI should optimize spreads based on multiple factors
    And spreads should be competitive yet profitable
    And risk exposure should be controlled

  Scenario: Inventory risk management
    Given market making involves holding inventory
    When managing position risk
    Then AI should balance inventory levels automatically
    And hedging strategies should be implemented
    And risk limits should be enforced

  Scenario: Adverse selection protection
    Given informed traders may trade against market makers
    When detecting potentially adverse selection
    Then AI should identify suspicious trading patterns
    And spreads should be widened or quotes withdrawn
    And losses from adverse selection should be minimized

  Scenario: Multi-asset market making
    Given diverse product portfolios require liquidity
    When providing liquidity across multiple assets
    Then correlations between assets should be considered
    And cross-asset hedging should be optimized
    And portfolio risk should be managed holistically

  Scenario: High-frequency quote updates
    Given market conditions change rapidly
    When updating market quotes
    Then quotes should be updated in microseconds
    And latency should be minimized
    And quote quality should be maintained

  Scenario: Machine learning model adaptation
    Given market regimes change over time
    When market patterns evolve
    Then AI models should adapt automatically
    And model performance should be monitored
    And retraining should occur when necessary

  Scenario: Liquidity provision during stress events
    Given markets may experience extreme volatility
    When market stress occurs
    Then liquidity provision should be carefully managed
    And risk controls should prevent excessive losses
    And market stability should be supported where appropriate

  Scenario: Client flow internalization
    Given customer order flow provides valuable information
    When internalizing client trades
    Then customer orders should be filled at fair prices
    And price improvement should be provided where possible
    And regulatory best execution requirements should be met

  Scenario: Alternative trading systems (ATS) participation
    Given multiple trading venues exist
    When participating in dark pools and ATS
    Then optimal venue selection should be automated
    And execution quality should be measured
    And market impact should be minimized

  Scenario: Cross-venue arbitrage opportunities
    Given price differences may exist across venues
    When identifying arbitrage opportunities
    Then AI should detect and execute arbitrage trades
    And execution should be simultaneous across venues
    And transaction costs should be considered

  Scenario: Regulatory compliance monitoring
    Given market making is heavily regulated
    When operating market making algorithms
    Then all trading should comply with regulations
    And audit trails should be maintained
    And regulatory reporting should be automated

  Scenario: Client order toxicity detection
    Given some client orders may be more informed
    When receiving client orders
    Then order toxicity should be assessed in real-time
    And pricing should be adjusted for toxic flow
    And client relationships should be managed appropriately

  Scenario: Market making performance attribution
    Given multiple strategies contribute to P&L
    When analyzing trading performance
    Then profits should be attributed to specific strategies
    And risk-adjusted returns should be calculated
    And strategy allocation should be optimized
