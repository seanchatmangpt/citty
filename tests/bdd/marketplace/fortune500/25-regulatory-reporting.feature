Feature: Regulatory Reporting Automation
  As a Fortune 500 compliance executive
  I want automated regulatory reporting across all jurisdictions
  So that compliance requirements are met efficiently and accurately

  Background:
    Given regulatory reporting automation is operational
    And compliance rules are configured for all jurisdictions
    And data quality management is in place
    And audit trails are maintained

  Scenario: Multi-jurisdiction regulatory reporting
    Given operations span multiple countries and regions
    When generating regulatory reports
    Then reports should be customized for each jurisdiction
    And filing requirements should be met automatically
    And deadlines should be tracked and managed

  Scenario: Real-time transaction reporting
    Given certain transactions require immediate reporting
    When transactions are executed
    Then qualifying transactions should be reported within seconds
    And regulatory authorities should receive complete data
    And confirmation of receipt should be tracked

  Scenario: Automated data quality validation
    Given regulatory reports require high data quality
    When preparing reports
    Then data should be validated against business rules
    And exceptions should be flagged for review
    And data lineage should be traceable

  Scenario: MiFID II transaction reporting
    Given European operations require MiFID II compliance
    When financial transactions occur
    Then transaction reports should be generated automatically
    And ARM (Approved Reporting Mechanism) should receive data
    And reporting completeness should be verified

  Scenario: Dodd-Frank swaps reporting
    Given US derivatives operations require Dodd-Frank compliance
    When swap transactions are executed
    Then swap data repositories should be notified
    And required data elements should be included
    And reporting timelines should be met

    Given European derivatives operations
    When derivative trades are executed
    Then EMIR reporting requirements should be met
    And trade repositories should receive complete data
    And reconciliation should be performed

  Scenario: Large exposures reporting
    Given significant counterparty exposures
    When exposure thresholds are exceeded
    Then large exposure reports should be generated
    And supervisory authorities should be notified
    And ongoing monitoring should be maintained

  Scenario: Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) reporting
    Given banking operations require liquidity reporting
    When calculating liquidity positions
    Then LCR should be calculated accurately
    And regulatory submissions should be automated
    And early warning indicators should be monitored

  Scenario: Suspicious activity reporting (SAR)
    Given AML/CFT compliance requirements
    When suspicious patterns are detected
    Then SARs should be generated and filed
    And regulatory timelines should be met
    And follow-up actions should be tracked

  Scenario: Cross-border data protection compliance
    Given GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
    When processing personal data
    Then data protection compliance should be automated
    And breach notifications should be generated
    And data subject rights should be facilitated

  Scenario: Regulatory change management
    Given regulations evolve continuously
    When new requirements are introduced
    Then system configurations should be updated
    And impact assessments should be performed
    And implementation should be tracked

  Scenario: Regulatory reporting analytics
    Given large volumes of regulatory data
    When analyzing reporting patterns
    Then insights should be provided to management
    And trends should be identified
    And risk indicators should be highlighted

  Scenario: Audit trail and documentation
    Given regulators require comprehensive audit trails
    When maintaining compliance documentation
    Then all activities should be logged
