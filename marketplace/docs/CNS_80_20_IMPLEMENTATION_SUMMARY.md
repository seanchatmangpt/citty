## Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. WebSocket Optimization (CNS Pattern)
```typescript
// 80/20: Core channels prioritized
const coreChannels = ['marketplace', 'auctions', 'notifications']
const advancedChannels = ['analytics', 'social', 'admin']

// Smart connection management
const connectToPipeline = (callbacks) => {
  // Connect to core channels immediately
  // Advanced channels loaded on-demand
}
```

### 2. Component Loading Strategy
```vue
<!-- Core components always loaded -->
<OptimizedMetricCard :metric="coreMetrics[0]" />

<!-- Advanced components lazy-loaded -->
<LazyAdvancedMetrics v-if="showAdvanced" />
```

### 3. Data Fetching Optimization
```typescript
// 80/20: Essential data first, enhancements follow
const search = async (query, options) => {
  // Fast basic search
  const basicResults = await basicSearch(query)
  
  // Optional semantic enhancement
  if (options.enableSemantic) {
    return await enhanceWithSemantics(basicResults)
  }
  
  return basicResults
}
```
