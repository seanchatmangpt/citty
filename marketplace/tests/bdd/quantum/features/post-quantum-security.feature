Feature: Post-Quantum Security Testing
  As a quantum marketplace security engineer
  I want to test post-quantum cryptographic systems
  So that marketplace security remains intact against quantum attacks

  Background:
    Given I have post-quantum cryptography simulators
    And I initialize quantum-resistant marketplace security

  @post-quantum @lattice
  Scenario: Lattice-based key generation and encryption
    Given I need quantum-resistant encryption
    When I generate lattice-based key pairs
    Then key generation should complete successfully
    And public keys should be computationally indistinguishable
    And private keys should remain secure against quantum attacks
    And encryption should maintain semantic security

  @post-quantum @lattice @kyber
  Scenario: CRYSTALS-Kyber key encapsulation
    Given two marketplace parties need secure communication
    When I use CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation
    Then key agreement should be established securely
    And encapsulation should resist quantum attacks
    And decapsulation should recover the shared secret
    And the protocol should maintain forward secrecy

  @post-quantum @lattice @dilithium
  Scenario: CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signatures
    Given marketplace transactions need digital signatures
    When I use CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signing
    Then signatures should be generated correctly
    And signature verification should succeed
    And forgery resistance should be quantum-safe
    And signature size should be practical for deployment

  @post-quantum @code-based
  Scenario: McEliece cryptosystem for secure messaging
    Given secure messaging requirements in marketplace
    When I implement McEliece code-based encryption
    Then encryption should utilize error-correcting codes
    And decryption should recover original messages
    And security should rely on syndrome decoding hardness
    And system should resist quantum cryptanalysis

  @post-quantum @code-based @bike
  Scenario: BIKE (Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation)
    Given need for efficient code-based key exchange
    When I implement BIKE algorithm
    Then key sizes should be smaller than classic McEliece
    And security should be based on syndrome decoding
    And error patterns should be generated securely
    And performance should be suitable for practice

  @post-quantum @hash-based
  Scenario: XMSS hash-based signatures
    Given long-term signature requirements
    When I implement XMSS signature scheme
    Then one-time signatures should be generated securely
    And Merkle tree should provide authentication
    And signature count should be limited but sufficient
    And quantum resistance should be information-theoretic

  @post-quantum @hash-based @sphincs
  Scenario: SPHINCS+ stateless signatures
    Given need for unlimited signatures
    When I use SPHINCS+ signature scheme
    Then signatures should be generated without state
    And security should be based on hash function security
    And signature generation should be efficient
    And verification should be fast and reliable

  @post-quantum @multivariate
  Scenario: Rainbow multivariate signatures
    Given compact signature requirements
    When I implement Rainbow multivariate scheme
    Then signatures should be short and efficient
    And security should rely on MQ-problem hardness
    And key generation should create valid parameters
    And signature verification should be fast

  @post-quantum @isogeny
  Scenario: SIDH isogeny-based key exchange
    Given need for smallest key sizes
    When I implement SIDH key exchange
    Then key exchange should use elliptic curve isogenies
    And shared secret should be established securely
    And key sizes should be minimal
    And security should resist quantum attacks
    Note: "SIDH has been broken, but useful for historical testing"

  @post-quantum @hybrid
  Scenario: Hybrid classical-quantum cryptography
    Given transition period security requirements  
    When I implement hybrid cryptographic systems
    Then both classical and post-quantum algorithms should run
    And security should be maintained if either system fails
    And performance overhead should be acceptable
    And backward compatibility should be preserved

  @post-quantum @migration
  Scenario: Cryptographic agility and migration
    Given existing marketplace with classical cryptography
    When I plan post-quantum migration
    Then cryptographic inventory should be assessed
    And migration timeline should be established
    And risk assessment should identify priorities
    And testing should validate quantum resistance

  @post-quantum @performance
  Scenario: Performance comparison of PQC algorithms
    Given multiple post-quantum algorithms available
    When I benchmark algorithm performance
    Then key generation speed should be measured
    And encryption/decryption throughput should be tested
    And signature generation/verification should be timed
    And memory usage should be profiled

  @post-quantum @nist
  Scenario: NIST standardization compliance
    Given NIST post-quantum cryptography standards
    When I implement standardized algorithms
    Then implementations should follow NIST specifications
    And security parameters should meet required levels
    And test vectors should pass validation
    And interoperability should be verified

  @post-quantum @security-analysis
  Scenario: Quantum attack simulation
    Given post-quantum cryptographic implementations
    When I simulate quantum attacks
    Then Shor's algorithm should not break the system
    And Grover's algorithm impact should be assessed
    And quantum advantage should be neutralized
    And security margins should remain adequate
