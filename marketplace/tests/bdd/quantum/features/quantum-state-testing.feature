Feature: Quantum State Testing
  As a quantum marketplace developer
  I want to test quantum superposition and entanglement scenarios
  So that I can verify quantum-enhanced marketplace behaviors

  Background:
    Given I have a quantum state simulator
    And I initialize a marketplace with quantum capabilities

  @quantum @superposition
  Scenario: User in quantum superposition state
    Given a user exists in quantum superposition
    When I observe the user's shopping state
    Then the user should collapse to either "browsing" or "purchasing"
    And the measurement should affect other entangled users
    And the quantum fidelity should be greater than 0.95

  @quantum @entanglement
  Scenario: Entangled transaction verification
    Given two users are quantum entangled
    And user A initiates a transaction
    When I measure user A's transaction state
    Then user B's transaction state should instantly collapse
    And both users should have correlated transaction outcomes
    And the entanglement entropy should be maximized

  @quantum @interference
  Scenario: Quantum interference in price discovery
    Given multiple price states exist in superposition
    And quantum interference patterns are applied
    When market conditions change phase
    Then constructive interference should amplify optimal prices
    And destructive interference should eliminate poor prices
    And the final price should converge to quantum equilibrium

  @quantum @decoherence
  Scenario: Quantum decoherence in user sessions
    Given a user session in quantum coherence
    And environmental noise is introduced
    When decoherence time exceeds the threshold
    Then the session should transition to classical state
    And quantum advantages should be preserved until decoherence
    And error correction should maintain data integrity

  @quantum @tunneling
  Scenario: Quantum tunneling in payment processing
    Given a payment barrier exists in the system
    And the payment amount has quantum properties
    When quantum tunneling is enabled
    Then low-energy payments should tunnel through barriers
    And processing time should follow quantum tunneling rates
    And successful tunneling should update payment state

  @quantum @bell_state
  Scenario: Bell state creation for secure transactions
    Given two transaction parties exist
    When I create a Bell state between them
    Then measuring one party should instantly affect the other
    And the Bell inequality should be violated
    And the transaction should be quantum secure
    And no information should leak during measurement

  @quantum @ghz_state
  Scenario: Multi-party GHZ state for group transactions
    Given multiple parties in a group transaction
    When I create a GHZ state among all parties
    Then measuring any party should affect all others
    And all parties should show maximum entanglement
    And the group decision should be quantum coordinated
    And consensus should be reached instantly

  @quantum @phase_estimation
  Scenario: Quantum phase estimation for market timing
    Given market data with unknown phase information
    When I apply quantum phase estimation
    Then the algorithm should extract phase with exponential precision
    And market cycles should be identified accurately
    And trading timing should be optimized
    And quantum advantage should be demonstrated

  @quantum @amplitude_amplification
  Scenario: Amplitude amplification for rare event detection
    Given a large dataset with rare fraud patterns
    When I apply quantum amplitude amplification
    Then fraud detection probability should be amplified
    And search time should be reduced quadratically
    And false positive rate should be minimized
    And detection accuracy should exceed classical methods

  @quantum @quantum_walks
  Scenario: Quantum random walks for recommendation paths
    Given a user preference graph
    When I perform quantum random walks
    Then recommendation paths should explore superposition
    And quantum interference should enhance relevant paths
    And walk convergence should be faster than classical
    And recommendations should show quantum enhancement
